## Attack Process

### 1. Payload Preparation
1. **Start C2 Server**: Initialize the C2 server on a publicly accessible host
   ```
   cd c2_server
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Generate Payload**: Choose between standalone or binding options:
   - **Standalone APK**: Creates a new application disguised as a system service
   - **APK Binding**: Injects RAT code into a legitimate application

3. **Configure Payload**:
   - Set C2 server address (e.g., `https://your-c2-server.com`)
   - Customize application name and icon (if using standalone option)
   - Set additional parameters like API keys if required

### 2. Payload Delivery
Several methods can be used to deliver the payload to the target device:

1. **Social Engineering**: Trick the user into installing the application
   - Phishing emails with download links
   - Fake application stores or websites
   - Direct messaging platforms

2. **Physical Access**: Install directly if physical access to the device is available

3. **Drive-By Download**: Exploit browser vulnerabilities to install without user interaction

### 3. Initial Access & Persistence
1. **Installation**: Target installs the infected application
   - On first run, the application requests necessary permissions
   - The RAT establishes persistence mechanisms
   - Background services are initiated

2. **Connection Establishment**:
   - RAT connects to the C2 server
   - Device information is transmitted
   - Device appears in the C2 server web interface

### 4. Control & Data Exfiltration
1. **Device Control**:
   - Administrator issues commands through the C2 web interface
   - Commands are encrypted and queued for the device
   - Device polls the server and executes commands

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Sensitive data is collected automatically (contacts, SMS, location)
   - Screenshots and keystrokes are captured
   - All data is encrypted before transmission

3. **Sensitive Operation Execution**:
   - Advanced operations like camera access require explicit commands
   - Results are encrypted and sent back to the C2 server

## Advanced Operational Security
- **Post-Quantum Resistant Encryption**: Multi-layered encryption with post-quantum readiness
- **Enhanced AES-256 Implementation**: Using CBC mode with PKCS7Padding and secure key derivation
- **Anti-Replay Protection**: Timestamped commands with expiration to prevent replay attacks
- **Command Verification**: Cryptographic verification of high-risk commands
- **Secure Command Queue**: Commands are securely stored with encryption until execution
- **Intelligent Transmission**: Data transmission only occurs under favorable security conditions
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: All stored data is encrypted with layered protection
